#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
select count(orderID)
from JanSales
where length(OrderID)= 6      --length of an order ID is 6 characters
and OrderID != 'OrderID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count(orderID)
from JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone'
and length(OrderID)= 6     --length of an order ID is usually 6 characters
and orderID != 'orderID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum
from customers

inner join FebSales
on customers.order_id = Febsales.orderID
where length(orderID) = 6
and orderID != 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct product, price        -- Using distnct to remove duplicates
from JanSales
order by price asc                   -- ascending in price
limit 1; -- limit to the cheapest product

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity)* price as revenue,product
from JanSales
group by product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
sum(Quantity) as quantity,   -- quantity wants to be known
product, 
sum(quantity)* price         -- Revenue wants to be known
from FebSales
where location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
Select count( distinct acctnum) as accountnum,    -- distinct to eliminate 
avg(quantity* price) as avg_price_per_customer
from FebSales
left join customers
on Febsales.orderID = customers.order_id
where quantity > 2
and length(orderID) = 6
and orderID != 'orderID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
select Product,
sum(Quantity) as quantity
from FebSales
where location like '%Los Angeles%' 
group by Product;
